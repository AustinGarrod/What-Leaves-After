# What Leaves After (Depreciated)

This website was developed to make it easier for player's of Nintendo's Animal Crossing to tell what creatures and fish leave when.

A scraping tool was developed to pull the data from sources on the web.

Due to a lack of available time to spend on this project, it has unfortunately fallen behind in updates and has been depreciated. Hopefully I will be able to return to it in time, for now the code is available here to use if you would like.
